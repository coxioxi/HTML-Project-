                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Scrabble.java">Multiplayer Scrabble Application:</a>
                        A Java application that allows multiple players to play Scrabble online, featuring real-time updates and score tracking.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Tutor-and-Student-Pairing.java">Tutor and Student Pairing System:</a>
                        A Java-based scheduling application for tutor-student pairing, built using JavaFX for the user interface. 
                        The application matches students with tutors based on availability and subject preferences, 
                        featuring a dynamic grid-based schedule view to manage time slots efficiently.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Asteroids.java">Asteroids Game:</a>
                        A classic arcade-style game where players control a spaceship to destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions. 
                        Built using Java Swing for the graphical interface, the game features smooth animations, sound effects.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Graph.java"> Graph Analyzer:</a>
                        A Java application that allows users to perform various operations on the graph, such as checking connectivity, 
                        finding the minimum spanning tree, computing the shortest paths, checking if the graph is metric, making the graph metric, 
                        solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and approximating TSP.

                <h2>C Projects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/HTTP-server-">HTTP Server:</a>:
                        A simple HTTP server implemented in C The server serves static files to clients over the HTTP protocol. 
                        It listens on a specified port for incoming HTTP requests, processes those requests, and sends back the appropriate response.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Movies-Database">Movies Database:</a>
                        A C program that manages a database of movies. The program allows users to add, delete, search, and display movies in the database. 
                        It uses file handling to store movie data persistently and provides a simple text-based interface for user interaction.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/Intrusion-Detection-System-Server">Intrusion Detection System Server:</a>
                        This project implements a client-side application in C that communicates with a precompiled Intrusion Detection System (IDS) server via POSIX message queues.
                        The client requests metadata about specified files and compares server-provided data with local file attributes to detect potential corruption or unauthorized changes.
                    <br><br></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/coxioxi/CGI-Based-Dynamic-Web-Server">CGI Based Dynamic Web Server:</a>
                        A C program that implements a simple web server capable of handling CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts. 
                        The server can execute CGI scripts to generate dynamic content, allowing for more interactive web applications.
